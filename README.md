# Zillow HackHouse Hackathon: Happy Housing

The purpose of this app is to help recent immigrants of Seattle find affordable housing close to either their workplace, home, or preferred living location.

This application was developed on from February 6, 2015 to February February 8, 2015 for the [Hack Housing: Empowering Smarter Decisions â€“ A Weekend Hackathon](http://investors.zillow.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=892685).

Our app is live at http://hh-helptheworld.herokuapp.com/homeful/. 

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for [Challenge #3: Build an app that provides an example of an Awesome Hackathon submission](http://example.com/this-also-goes-nowhere).

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Analyze current low income housing opportunities such as HUD, Seattle public housing, and Section 8.
- for much of these opportunities we realize that there is a waiting list.
- We identified that our customers would like recommendations on housing near their work or home.
- The application can be customize to their preferred language
- We pulled from the [Multi Family Data](http://zillowhack.hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c55eb46fbc3b472cabd0c2a41f805261_0)
- We pulled from the [Fair Market Rent Data](http://zillowhack.hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e29dca94b6924766a124d7c767e03b75_0)
- We use the FMR to give the search an idea of the price range for the apartments
- We use the multi-family data to provide contact information and addresses to allow in person or telephone contact.
