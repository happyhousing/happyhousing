## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for [Challenge #3: Build an app that provides an example of an Awesome Hackathon submission](http://example.com/this-also-goes-nowhere).

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Share it on Github
- Collect feedback from the community

Once we did that, we knew we were guaranteed to win!
